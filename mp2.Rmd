Question: How do democratic and republican candidates spend their money? Who spends more money? Whose money is spent more effectively? Do democrats or republicans have better financing strategies?

## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```
Viewing the data
```{r}
head(house_elections)
head(candidates)
head(committees)
head(contributions)
```

```{r}
contributions %>%
  group_by(transaction_type) %>%
  summarize(n_ish = n_distinct(transaction_type))
against_list <- c("24A", "24N")
pro_contributions <- contributions %>%
  filter(transaction_type != against_list)
pro_contributions
```
I'm making a change!
